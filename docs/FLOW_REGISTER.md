# PJL Backend Flow Register

**Source of truth for customer-facing backend processes.**
Last updated: 2026-08-01 — supersedes the 2026-07-30 version.

If a flow isn't in here with a status, it is not known to work.
Update this file, not a chat thread.

---

## How to use this

1. **Nothing new ships** until the flow it touches is listed here.
2. A flow is marked **PASS** only after Patrick has personally walked it end to end and
   observed each hop. Not read code. Not assumed. Walked it.
3. Every defect gets an ID and stays here until fixed or deliberately closed.
4. Re-verify a flow after any change that touches its hop chain.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PASS | Walked end to end, every hop observed working |
| PARTIAL | Some hops verified, some unknown |
| UNMAPPED | Flow exists but hop chain not written down |
| BROKEN | Confirmed failure at a named hop |
| MANUAL | Depends on a human action, not code |

# Part 1 — Infrastructure

## INF — Outbound email

**Verified 2026-07-30 via raw message headers.**

- **Mailer:** Nodemailer (MIME boundary `_NmP-`)
- **Transport:** authenticated SMTP to `smtp.gmail.com` (ESMTPSA)
- **Sending identity:** `patrick@pjllandservices.com` (Google Workspace)
- **Origin host:** Render (`ip-74-220-50-51.ohio-egress.render.com`)
- **Authentication:** SPF pass · DKIM pass (`d=pjllandservices.com`) · DMARC pass
- **Reply-To:** `info@pjllandservices.com`

Domain authentication is correctly configured. This is why mail reaches inbox, not spam.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| INF-01 | Medium | App sends `From: info@`, Google rewrites to `patrick@` (proof: header `X-Google-Original-From`). Cause: `info@` is not a verified send-as alias on the authenticating account. Fix: verify `info@` as a send-as identity, or authenticate SMTP as `info@`. |
| INF-02 | **High** | **Single point of failure.** All customer email — login links, quote notifications, invoices, receipts — depends on one Workspace mailbox and its app password. Password rotation, 2FA change, revoked app password, or a Google flag stops all customer email at once. Unknown whether failures are logged or silent. |
| INF-03 | Low | DMARC is `p=NONE` — monitoring only, not enforcing. No spoofing protection. |
| INF-04 | Low | Workspace SMTP has a daily send cap. Not a constraint now, but a known ceiling before any bulk/seasonal sending. |

# Part 2 — Verified flows

## FLOW-01 — Existing customer portal login — **PASS**

Verified end to end 2026-07-30.

| # | Hop | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Customer enters email in sitewide portal field | PASS |
| 2 | Submit reaches server | PASS |
| 3 | Server matches email to customer record | PASS (personalised greeting) |
| 4 | Magic-link token generated — 30 min, single use | PASS |
| 5 | Email sent via Nodemailer → Workspace SMTP | PASS |
| 6 | Delivered to inbox, not spam | PASS |
| 7 | Link clicked → session created → portal renders customer data | PASS |

**Design decisions worth preserving — do not "improve" these:**
- Confirmation reads "If we found you…" — deliberately does not confirm whether an address
  exists. Prevents strangers probing the customer list.
- Phone number shown as fallback on the confirmation screen.
- Email contains both a button and a paste-able URL.

**Not yet tested:** unrecognised email address, expired token, reused token.

## FLOW-02 — Portal in-session actions — **PASS** (one MANUAL dependency)

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| "Send PJL a Message" → submit | PASS — notification to phone **and** email |
| Notification preferences → Save → reload | PASS — persists |
| Stage tracker advance | **MANUAL** — Patrick advances by hand |

**MANUAL risk:** the portal promises *"PJL will follow up as soon as your request is reviewed."*
That promise holds only if the tracker is moved. A stale tracker is indistinguishable from
being ignored, from the customer's side.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| UI-01 | Low | Empty unlabeled input above "Your Zones" in the "Your System" card. Orphaned field, origin unknown. Find what writes to it before deleting. |

# Part 3 — Intake

## The map

The site has **50+ pages but only ~10 intake destinations.** "Get a Free Estimate" and the
phone number appear in header and footer sitewide — that is one destination with 50+ doors,
not 50 flows. Fix the destination and every door is fixed.

| ID | Destination | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| FLOW-03 | `/book.html` — Book Online, real-time availability | Contact page, footer |
| FLOW-04 | `/quote.html` — 4-step Sprinkler Quote Builder | Header + footer, **sitewide** |
| FLOW-05 | `/estimate.html` — Free Installation Estimate | Footer |
| FLOW-06 | `/contact.html` — enquiry form | Nav, sitewide |
| FLOW-07 | `/new-customer` — self-intake (unlisted, sent by Patrick) | Private link |
| FLOW-08 | `/commercial-new-customer` — commercial self-intake (unlisted) | Private link |
| FLOW-09 | `/sprinkler-repair.html` — AI diagnostic intake | Its own page |
| FLOW-10 | Phone `(905) 960-0181` | Header + footer sitewide |
| FLOW-11 | `info@pjllandservices.com` mailto | Footer |
| FLOW-12 | Facebook / Instagram | Footer |

**CONFIRMED 2026-08-01:** every web intake reaches the CRM and is tagged by source.
Source tags observed: Sprinkler Repair · New Sprinkler Quote · Customer Self Intake ·
Commercial · AI Diagnostic Chat · General Contact · Spring Opening · Fall Closing.

**Commercial tagging works** — records show Customer Self Intake + Commercial together.
Previously logged as a change order; **closed, already built.**

## Evidence — CRM export, 56 records, 2026-04-30 to 2026-07-29

| Path | Records | Won | Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booking (`/book.html`) | 29 | 28 | Real — $90 to $1,195 |
| Self-intake (`/new-customer`) | 16 | 2 | $0 on every record |
| Quote builder (`/quote.html`) | 4 | 0 | $0 |
| Contact / misc | 7 | 0 | $0 |

**The booking flow is the business.** Effectively all revenue in the CRM came through it.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| CRM-01 | **High** | **Self-intake creates duplicates.** Sending `/new-customer` to someone already in the CRM creates a second lead instead of matching the existing record. 14 of 16 self-intake records are frozen at "new", $0, permanently — the real job lives on a separate booking record. Confirmed pairs: Ravka, Dhesi, Gullo, Schwarz, Schafler, Mangos, Leung. **Untested consequence:** portal login matches on email; with two records per email, the magic link may open the empty record instead of real history. |
| CRM-02 | **High** | **`/quote.html` is the weakest path despite the strongest placement.** Sitewide header + footer button; 4 leads in 3 months; one is Patrick's own test; zero converted. `/estimate.html` produced no identifiable records at all. Three competing estimate paths, one of which earns nothing. |
| CRM-03 | Medium | **Follow-up and owner fields never used.** Zero of 56 records have a follow-up date or owner assigned. Mechanism is built and unused — directly related to the six-day-stale request found 2026-07-30. |
| CRM-04 | Low | Test data live in pipeline: `John Charette — "Test booking with a fake address"`, site_visit, since 2026-04-30. |
| CRM-05 | Low | Two SEO-spam submissions via contact form. Honeypot catches bots, not human-sent spam. |
| CRM-06 | Low | `/commercial-new-customer` serves the residential canonical tag, title, and meta description. Page content differs (rendered client-side); metadata was never differentiated. |

# Part 4 — Unmapped

Nothing below has been walked. Assume nothing works until verified.

| ID | Flow | Note |
|---|---|---|
| FLOW-20 | Quote written → delivered to customer | Money moves here |
| FLOW-21 | Quote viewed → accepted | |
| FLOW-22 | Invoice generated → delivered | |
| FLOW-23 | Payment captured → receipt → marked paid | |
| FLOW-24 | Form failure → does anything alert Patrick? | Contact page shows "Your message didn't send." Unknown whether that failure is logged anywhere. |
| FLOW-25 | AI diagnostic tool (`/sprinkler-repair.html`) | Carries a financial promise: "correct diagnosis = 1 hr labour free." Runs on Cloudflare Worker + API key — a dependency chain separate from Render and from email. |
| MISC-01 | Footer links to Toronto, North York, Lawrence Park, Forest Hill are absent from `sitemap.html`. Four taps to confirm whether they 404. Sitewide footer links. |
| MISC-02 | `sitemap.html` section counters stale: "Services · 10 pages" lists 11; "Book / Quote / Estimate · 3 pages" lists 4. |

# Part 5 — Dispatch rules

The drift came from delegated jobs shipping changes nobody read or verified.

1. **One job at a time** on the backend.
2. **Every job names the flow IDs it touches**, from this register.
3. **Every job ships with a written acceptance test** — the exact taps Patrick performs, as a customer.
4. **A job is not done** until Patrick has run that test and updated this file.
5. **No job touches a flow marked PASS** without re-verifying it afterward.
