# PJL Backend Flow Register

**Source of truth for customer-facing backend processes.**
Last updated: 2026-08-02 — supersedes the 2026-08-01 version.

If a flow isn't in here with a status, it is not known to work.
Update this file, not a chat thread.

---

## How to use this

1. **Nothing new ships** until the flow it touches is listed here.
2. A flow is marked **PASS** only after Patrick has personally walked it end to end and
   observed each hop. Not read code. Not assumed. Walked it.
3. Every defect gets an ID and stays here until fixed or deliberately closed.
4. Re-verify a flow after any change that touches its hop chain.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PASS | Walked end to end, every hop observed working |
| PARTIAL | Some hops verified, some unknown |
| UNMAPPED | Flow exists but hop chain not written down |
| BROKEN | Confirmed failure at a named hop |
| MANUAL | Depends on a human action, not code |

# Part 1 — Infrastructure

## INF — Outbound email

**Verified 2026-07-30 via raw message headers.**

- **Mailer:** Nodemailer (MIME boundary `_NmP-`)
- **Transport:** authenticated SMTP to `smtp.gmail.com` (ESMTPSA)
- **Sending identity:** `patrick@pjllandservices.com` (Google Workspace)
- **Origin host:** Render (`ip-74-220-50-51.ohio-egress.render.com`)
- **Authentication:** SPF pass · DKIM pass (`d=pjllandservices.com`) · DMARC pass
- **Reply-To:** `info@pjllandservices.com`

Domain authentication is correctly configured. This is why mail reaches inbox, not spam.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| INF-01 | Medium | App sends `From: info@`, Google rewrites to `patrick@` (proof: header `X-Google-Original-From`). Cause: `info@` is not a verified send-as alias on the authenticating account. Fix: verify `info@` as a send-as identity, or authenticate SMTP as `info@`. |
| INF-02 | **High** | **Single point of failure.** All customer email — login links, quote notifications, invoices, receipts — depends on one Workspace mailbox and its app password. Password rotation, 2FA change, revoked app password, or a Google flag stops all customer email at once. Unknown whether failures are logged or silent. |
| INF-03 | Low | DMARC is `p=NONE` — monitoring only, not enforcing. No spoofing protection. |
| INF-04 | Low | Workspace SMTP has a daily send cap. Not a constraint now, but a known ceiling before any bulk/seasonal sending. |

# Part 2 — Verified flows

## FLOW-01 — Existing customer portal login — **PASS**

Verified end to end 2026-07-30.

| # | Hop | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Customer enters email in sitewide portal field | PASS |
| 2 | Submit reaches server | PASS |
| 3 | Server matches email to customer record | PASS (personalised greeting) |
| 4 | Magic-link token generated — 30 min, single use | PASS |
| 5 | Email sent via Nodemailer → Workspace SMTP | PASS |
| 6 | Delivered to inbox, not spam | PASS |
| 7 | Link clicked → session created → portal renders customer data | PASS |

**Design decisions worth preserving — do not "improve" these:**
- Confirmation reads "If we found you…" — deliberately does not confirm whether an address
  exists. Prevents strangers probing the customer list.
- Phone number shown as fallback on the confirmation screen.
- Email contains both a button and a paste-able URL.

**Not yet tested:** unrecognised email address, expired token, reused token.

## FLOW-02 — Portal in-session actions — **PASS** (one MANUAL dependency)

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| "Send PJL a Message" → submit | PASS — notification to phone **and** email |
| Notification preferences → Save → reload | PASS — persists |
| Stage tracker advance | **MANUAL** — Patrick advances by hand |

**MANUAL risk:** the portal promises *"PJL will follow up as soon as your request is reviewed."*
That promise holds only if the tracker is moved. A stale tracker is indistinguishable from
being ignored, from the customer's side.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| UI-01 | Low | Empty unlabeled input above "Your Zones" in the "Your System" card. Orphaned field, origin unknown. Find what writes to it before deleting. |

# Part 3 — Intake

## The map

The site has **50+ pages but only ~10 intake destinations.** "Get a Free Estimate" and the
phone number appear in header and footer sitewide — that is one destination with 50+ doors,
not 50 flows. Fix the destination and every door is fixed.

| ID | Destination | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| FLOW-03 | `/book.html` — Book Online, real-time availability | Contact page, footer, **and since 2026-08-02 the sitewide header + footer "Get a Free Estimate" CTA** |
| FLOW-04 | `/quote.html` — 4-step Sprinkler Quote Builder | In-body links only (held header + footer sitewide until 2026-08-02; that CTA now points to `/book.html`) |
| FLOW-05 | `/estimate.html` — Free Installation Estimate | In-body links only (held a footer link until 2026-08-02; that link now points to `/book.html`) |
| FLOW-06 | `/contact.html` — enquiry form | Nav, sitewide |
| FLOW-07 | `/new-customer` — self-intake (unlisted, sent by Patrick) | Private link |
| FLOW-08 | `/commercial-new-customer` — commercial self-intake (unlisted) | Private link |
| FLOW-09 | `/sprinkler-repair.html` — AI diagnostic intake | Its own page |
| FLOW-10 | Phone `(905) 960-0181` | Header + footer sitewide |
| FLOW-11 | `info@pjllandservices.com` mailto | Footer |
| FLOW-12 | Facebook / Instagram | Footer |

**CONFIRMED 2026-08-01:** every web intake reaches the CRM and is tagged by source.
Source tags observed: Sprinkler Repair · New Sprinkler Quote · Customer Self Intake ·
Commercial · AI Diagnostic Chat · General Contact · Spring Opening · Fall Closing.

**Commercial tagging works** — records show Customer Self Intake + Commercial together.
Previously logged as a change order; **closed, already built.**

**JOB-001 verified 2026-08-02** — both acceptance tests walked by Patrick against live data:

| ID | Status | What was walked |
|---|---|---|
| FLOW-07 | **PASS** | Self-intake walked end to end. Existing email → existing record updated, no duplicate, alert says "existing record updated". Unknown email → new lead tagged Customer Self Intake, alert says "new record". Commercial variant (`/commercial-new-customer`, FLOW-08) same behaviour, Commercial tag retained. |
| FLOW-04 | **PARTIAL** | Page verified live at its URL; sitewide CTA repointed to `/book.html`. The 4-step quote-builder flow itself was not walked end to end — only its reachability was verified. |
| FLOW-05 | **PARTIAL** | Same: page verified live, footer link repointed to `/book.html`, estimator flow not walked end to end. |
| FLOW-03 | **PASS** (re-verified) | Real booking completed through `/book.html` after the CTA change: $105 Spring Opening, work order WO-ZDQL272C, correct source tag and dollar value in CRM, phone + email notifications fired. |

## Evidence — CRM export, 56 records, 2026-04-30 to 2026-07-29

| Path | Records | Won | Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booking (`/book.html`) | 29 | 28 | Real — $90 to $1,195 |
| Self-intake (`/new-customer`) | 16 | 2 | $0 on every record |
| Quote builder (`/quote.html`) | 4 | 0 | $0 |
| Contact / misc | 7 | 0 | $0 |

**The booking flow is the business.** Effectively all revenue in the CRM came through it.

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| CRM-01 | **CLOSED** 2026-08-02 | **Self-intake creates duplicates.** Was: sending `/new-customer` to someone already in the CRM created a second lead instead of matching the existing record; 14 of 16 self-intake records frozen at "new", $0. **Fixed by JOB-001 Task A:** `/api/new-customer` (both residential and commercial) now matches submissions against existing lead records by email (case-insensitive, trimmed) and updates the matched record + logs activity instead of creating a duplicate; notifications state updated-vs-created. Acceptance test run by Patrick against live data 2026-08-02 — all three scenarios passed (56 → 57 records, exactly one new lead from the unknown-email case). The portal-login consequence for the seven pre-existing duplicate pairs is now tracked as CRM-07. |
| CRM-02 | **CLOSED** 2026-08-02 | **`/quote.html` was the weakest path despite the strongest placement.** 4 leads in 3 months (one Patrick's own test), zero converted; `/estimate.html` produced no identifiable records. **Fixed by JOB-001 Task B:** the sitewide header + footer "Get a Free Estimate" CTA now points to `/book.html` on every page (83 templated pages + `quote-legacy.html`). `/quote.html` and `/estimate.html` remain live at their URLs — no redirects — and keep their in-body links (inventoried in the JOB-001 report). Acceptance test passed 2026-08-02: CTA verified on three page types, both old pages load, and a real booking completed end to end ($105 Spring Opening, WO-ZDQL272C, correct source tag, notifications fired). |
| CRM-03 | Medium | **Follow-up and owner fields never used.** Zero of 56 records have a follow-up date or owner assigned. Mechanism is built and unused — directly related to the six-day-stale request found 2026-07-30. |
| CRM-04 | Low | Test data live in pipeline: `John Charette — "Test booking with a fake address"`, site_visit, since 2026-04-30. |
| CRM-05 | Low | Two SEO-spam submissions via contact form. Honeypot catches bots, not human-sent spam. |
| CRM-06 | Low | `/commercial-new-customer` serves the residential canonical tag, title, and meta description. Page content differs (rendered client-side); metadata was never differentiated. |
| CRM-07 | **High** | **Portal login lands duplicate-pair customers on an empty portal.** Verified in code 2026-08-02: magic-link lookup (`resolveLoginIdentifier`, server.js) keeps the *most recently created* lead per email, and verification lands the session on the newest lead for the customer. For the seven confirmed duplicate pairs — Ravka, Dhesi, Gullo, Schwarz, Schafler, Mangos, Leung — the newest record is the frozen $0 self-intake duplicate, so login opens an empty portal instead of their real history. CRM-01's fix stops new duplicates from forming; the existing pairs still need a separate merge/cleanup job. **Shares its root cause with CRM-08** (portal identity is a single lead, not the customer) — scope any fix for the two together. |
| CRM-08 | **High** | **Completed work orders not visible in the customer portal.** Observed three times; one property with two work orders showed the invoice apparently linked to the spring opening rather than the correct work order, forcing manual PDF delivery. Root cause verified in code 2026-08-02, three layers, same underlying flaw as CRM-07: **(1)** the portal is lead-scoped and renders at most ONE work order — the `lead.booking.workOrder` envelope embedded in the single lead the portal token opens (server.js `buildPortalPayload`); a customer with two visits has the second WO on a different lead (public bookings mint a lead each) or overwritten in place (admin book-from-lead replaces `lead.booking` wholesale). **(2)** Nothing ever writes back to that envelope after booking — no code path updates its `status`/`documentReady`/`documentUrl` when the canonical WO (work-orders.json) completes, so even the right lead's portal card reads "Scheduled" forever with no report. **(3)** Invoices never appear in the main portal at all — `invoices.json` records carry the correct `woId`, but the only customer-facing surface is the separate token-gated `/portal/invoice/:id` link; inside the portal the only WO card the customer can see is whichever lead they landed on (the newest, per CRM-07), so the invoice "appears linked to" that visit. The data layer is correctly linked throughout — this is purely a portal-surface scoping problem: the unit of portal identity is a lead record, while the customer's real history spans leads + work orders + invoices keyed by customerId. Fix direction: portal should render by customer, not by lead. |
| CRM-09 | Medium | **Portal hero/stage/work-order cards reflect lead-level booking state only, never completed work.** Verified 2026-08-02 with a seeded customer whose only visit completed three months prior, nothing upcoming: header reads "Hi &lt;name&gt;, your service is scheduled" with "before we arrive" copy; the timeline rail ends at "Booked"; the stage card reads "Service Confirmed / PJL will follow up"; and the work-order card shows the completed visit as "SCHEDULED" for its months-past date with live Change/Cancel-appointment buttons and an "appointment already underway — please call us" notice. All four surfaces read from the lead's frozen `booking.workOrder` envelope and `crm.status` — the same never-updated snapshot behind CRM-08 — while the Part B service-history card directly below correctly shows the same WO as Completed with warranty. The page contradicts itself. Fix direction: derive hero/stage/WO-card state from the canonical stores (completedAt, upcoming bookings) like the history card does; suppress Change/Cancel controls when nothing is upcoming. |

## Warranty policy — authoritative (recorded 2026-08-02, JOB-002)

| Work order type | Warranty |
|---|---|
| `build` (installation) | **3 years** |
| `service_visit` | 1 year |
| `spring_opening` | 1 year |
| `fall_closing` | 1 year |

Installations carry 3 years; everything else 1 year. Hydrawise controller retrofits are
**service**, not installation — their `service_visit` typing is correct and must not be changed.
Parts replaced during a service call inherit the service warranty; warranty attaches to the work
order, not to individual components. Expiry is computed from the work order's `completedAt` +
type — single implementation in `server/lib/warranty.js` (`warrantyForWorkOrder`), shared with
the completion cascade's snapshot so the two cannot drift.

**JOB-002 Part A (completedAt foundation) — COMPLETE, acceptance test passed 2026-08-02.**
`completedAt` is a first-class field, server-stamped in `workOrders.update()` on every
completion path (tech UI, admin status change, bulk) at the same instant as the `status_change`
history entry; not client-patchable; preserved once set. Backfill applied on Render 2026-08-02
via `scripts/backfill-wo-completedat.js`: **25 records promoted from history timestamps, 0
unrecoverable** (all 25 completed records — the field was new, so every one qualified, not only
the 10 that also lacked `departedAt`). Backup:
`server/data-backup-2026-08-02T15-44-55-816Z-wo-completedat/`. Post-apply count verified:
completed 25, missing `completedAt` 0. Write-path verified live on both branches of the old
gap: tech-flow completion (WO-PEDFQN32) stamped `completedAt` + `departedAt`; admin status
change (WO-PJNZKTWP) stamped `completedAt` with `departedAt` null — the server-side stamp
works. CRM-07 and CRM-08 stay open — Part A is a prerequisite, not a fix; Part B (portal
rebuild) consumes it.

**JOB-002 Part B (portal renders by customer) — code shipped 2026-08-02, awaiting acceptance
test.** Touches FLOW-01 hop 7 and FLOW-02's page (hops 1–6, magic-link mechanics, message send,
prefs untouched in code and re-verified locally) — both flows require re-verification per rule 5
before CRM-08 closes. What shipped: the portal payload now carries `serviceHistory` (every
non-build work order for the customer, live from work-orders.json, newest first, warranty
labels from `warrantyForWorkOrder`, report PDF + read-only invoice per line) and `projects`
(stage rail Accepted→Deposit→Scheduled→Complete→Invoiced, day count, percent complete, project
invoices — no dailyLog/notes/materials/crew data, verified by sentinel leak-test). Magic-link
landing now prefers the newest lead WITH a booking. New token-gated downloads:
`/api/portal/:token/wo-report-snapshot/:woId` extended with customer-union authorization + live
customer-audience render fallback for pre-snapshot completions; new
`/api/portal/:token/invoice/:invoiceId/pdf` (drafts/voids never serve; cross-customer requests
403 — verified). Payments untouched per HANDOFF_STRIPE_PAYMENTS §6 — display only, no pay
controls in the new cards. CRM-07 finding recorded in the Part B report: with customer-scoped
rendering the duplicate pairs no longer produce a customer-visible failure.

# Part 4 — Unmapped

Nothing below has been walked. Assume nothing works until verified.

| ID | Flow | Note |
|---|---|---|
| FLOW-20 | Quote written → delivered to customer | Money moves here |
| FLOW-21 | Quote viewed → accepted | |
| FLOW-22 | Invoice generated → delivered | |
| FLOW-23 | Payment captured → receipt → marked paid | |
| FLOW-24 | Form failure → does anything alert Patrick? | Contact page shows "Your message didn't send." Unknown whether that failure is logged anywhere. |
| FLOW-25 | AI diagnostic tool (`/sprinkler-repair.html`) | Carries a financial promise: "correct diagnosis = 1 hr labour free." Runs on Cloudflare Worker + API key — a dependency chain separate from Render and from email. |
| MISC-01 | Footer links to Toronto, North York, Lawrence Park, Forest Hill are absent from `sitemap.html`. Four taps to confirm whether they 404. Sitewide footer links. |
| MISC-02 | `sitemap.html` section counters stale: "Services · 10 pages" lists 11; "Book / Quote / Estimate · 3 pages" lists 4. |

# Part 5 — Dispatch rules

The drift came from delegated jobs shipping changes nobody read or verified.

1. **One job at a time** on the backend.
2. **Every job names the flow IDs it touches**, from this register.
3. **Every job ships with a written acceptance test** — the exact taps Patrick performs, as a customer.
4. **A job is not done** until Patrick has run that test and updated this file.
5. **No job touches a flow marked PASS** without re-verifying it afterward.
